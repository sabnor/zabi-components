# Zabi Components Patch

This patch fixes critical null reference errors and variant mismatches in the zabi-components library.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Button Component Null Reference Error
- **Problem**: Button component was trying to access property 'f' on null object due to missing variants
- **Root Cause**: Stories referenced variants (`'ghost'`, `'link'`, `'neutral'`) that didn't exist in the component
- **Fix**: Added missing variants with proper CSS classes and null reference protection

### 2. Card Component Variant Mismatch
- **Problem**: Stories used `variant: 'interactive'` but component only supports `'default' | 'elevated'`
- **Fix**: Corrected stories to use `interactive: true` prop instead of variant

### 3. Alert Component Variant Mismatch
- **Problem**: Stories used `'danger'` variant but component only supports `'error'`
- **Problem**: Stories used `dismissible` prop but component uses `closable`
- **Fix**: Updated all stories to use correct variant and prop names
